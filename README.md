The HTML document in this project consists of a parent container with several child elements.
Each child element represents a different HTML element (e.g., headings, paragraphs, lists, buttons, and links), 
and CSS styling is applied to showcase the box model properties.

- The `.parent` div is the main container with a red border, padding, and margin.
- `.child1`, `.child2`, and `.child3` divs represent different types of content with their own styles.
- `<ul>` and `<li>` elements are used to create lists within a box.
- `<button>` and `<a>` elements are styled as boxes.
